# express-demo
A test demo from book 'web development with node.js and express'

I tried to learn express.js by reading this book and following the code from that book, but I soon noticed that there are lots of potential bugs in the code demo, so I have to add the code piece by piece. Doing so, I learn a lot from this process:)
